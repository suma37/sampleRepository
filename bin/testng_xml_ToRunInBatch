Batch Run
=========
to execute multiple test files(.java) we doa batch run 

we need a file called testng.xml to run test in batch 

Configuration in testng.xml
=============================

1. testng.xml file has some configuration which will tell testng which are the testcases which have to run in a single Batch

2. we can run any numberof test cases

3. the first name in the testng.xml is the Suite name...
	<suite name = "xyz">

4. the test name in the testng reports will be that given in the testng.xml file <test name = "yahoo news test">

5. in the class we mention the .java files to be executed

		<class name = "packagename.testname">
		in our example <class name = "Test.YahooTest">
		
6. the order of the test that will be the order in which we have mentioned in the testng.xml file.

7. to run the batch file .. Right click on testng.xml -> RunAs ->Testng Suite

8. the order in which the test are mentioned in the testng.xml is the order in which the test are executed.

9. to skip a test : in the method under the annotation @BeforeTest add <throw new SkipException(".....")>  

10. To Skip a Testcase in the test : @Test(enabled=false)

11.To set priority : @Test(Priority = 2) default value id 0 if we do not mention priority it will have default for all the TestCases
